## React TypeScript Boilerplate

Setting up a new React Project can be daunting with the amount of dependecies to install and configurations to be done. The work is tripled when you are creating the app in TypeScript.

I created this to make it easier for me/anyone to start a new React project with my most commonly used libraries and tools.

### Dependencies

- Router - React-Router
- State Management - Redux
- Middleware - Redux Saga
- UI Library - Chakra-UI
- Animation Library - Framer-Motion
